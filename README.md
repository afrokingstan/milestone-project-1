## UX Introduction
The purpose of this website was to create a dummy website with the goal of turning it into an actual website for my Dad's Accounting firm (P.S Shhh! I haven't old him yet). The firm has been operating for over 30 years and has had no website for over 30 years. 
In the course of this project I realised I had little knowledge of the types of services my Dad's Accounting firm offered. Considering that I am not ready to break the news to him about this project, I decided to call upon my good old fashion detective skills. I  researching similar firms and their websites and contacted relatives who were familiar with my Dad's firm. Finally I was able to put together a solid draft of the types of services offered and the features that were important for such a firm to have on their website. Armed with this knowledge I proceded to create a wire frame from my hand sketched frames. I presented the wire frames to my Mentor and close relatives and they approved of my wire frame. 
I now had the perfect wire frame this enabled me to proceed with developing the website while paying close attentionto the approved wireframe. 

The concept of the home page was inspired by the news, it is global news that Britain would be leaving the EU #BREXIT. There has been a focus on how  Brexit is affecting Britains economy and many businesses have had to close down. This concern gives rise to businesses needing to keep an eye on the news and seek professional help. There the home page gives clients a view of ongoing trends and offers to provide professional services.  

## Research Results
This includes my findings from similar firms website and the input of relatives.
1. I found that on similar websites image gallery was not popular.
2. I was told that the colours on the website should look professional.

## Development
#  Wire Frames
Adobe XD was used to create the wireframes (find them in the wireframes folder). Here I created one view for the mobile phones and another for desktop view. I found that the choice of colour for similar firms was simply 2 - 3 colour combination and they were white, grey and black or a shade close to black. I setteled for a proffesional colour combination of white, grey and dark blue. I didnt include an image gallery as this feature was not popular on similar sites.

# Code Editor
During the course of this project I made good use of AWS cloud 9 and Visual studio Code to write and edit my codes. 

# BackUP and Testing
All my codes were regularly backed on AWS cluod 9 and commited/push to my project github repository and I also saved a local copy on my hard drive. 
Testing was perfoned on
1. multiple browsers
2. google developer tools.
3. [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

# Deployment
I made use of github pages to publish my project here is the [link](https://afrokingstan.github.io/milestone_project_1/)

## User Experience
Here's some of the user experience
I like the colours on the website its not distracting it makes it look very professional.

I like that I can see google maps and use the get directions button and it takes me straight to google maps.

I like that contact  us page allows me to see the Head office address right next to the form this way i can use it as a referrence if needed.

I like the fonts used as they are sharp.

## Future Plans
I will realy love to turn this to a real website for my Dad and to implemet more dynamic scripts and content to the website.

## Acknowledgements
- My Mentor Reuben Ferrante was extremely supportive through out this project and he inspired the Location page which I am very proud of. 
- My Wife Michelle Mtetwa and my Brother Obinna Ntiajuka were my greatest critics, they made me work harder.
